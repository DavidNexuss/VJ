GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-\/platform library for Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-\/independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

\mbox{\hyperlink{news_news_34}{Release notes for version 3.\+4}} list new features, caveats and deprecations.

\mbox{\hyperlink{quick_guide}{Getting started}} is a guide for users new to GLFW. It takes you through how to write a small but complete program.

There are guides for each section of the API\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{intro_guide}{Introduction to the API}} – initialization, error handling and high-\/level design
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide}{Window guide}} – creating and working with windows and framebuffers
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{context_guide}{Context guide}} – working with Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES contexts
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{vulkan_guide}{Vulkan guide}} -\/ working with Vulkan objects and extensions
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{monitor_guide}{Monitor guide}} – enumerating and working with monitors and video modes
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{input_guide}{Input guide}} – receiving events, polling and processing input
\end{DoxyItemize}

Once you have written a program, see \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide}{Compiling GLFW}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide}{Building applications}}.

The \href{modules.html}{\texttt{ reference documentation}} provides more detailed information about specific functions.

\mbox{\hyperlink{moving_guide}{Moving from GLFW 2 to 3}} explains what has changed and how to update existing code to use the new API.

There is a section on \mbox{\hyperlink{intro_guide_guarantees_limitations}{Guarantees and limitations}} for pointer lifetimes, reentrancy, thread safety, event order and backward and forward compatibility.

The \href{https://www.glfw.org/faq.html}{\texttt{ FAQ}} answers many common questions about the design, implementation and use of GLFW.

Finally, \mbox{\hyperlink{compat_guide}{Standards conformance}} explains what APIs, standards and protocols GLFW uses and what happens when they are not present on a given machine.

This documentation was generated with Doxygen. The sources for it are available in both the \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ source distribution}} and \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub repository}}.
