This guide introduces the Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES context related functions of GLFW. For details on a specific function in this category, see the context. There are also guides for the other areas of the GLFW API.

A window object encapsulates both a top-\/level window and an Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES context. It is created with glfw\+Create\+Window and destroyed with glfw\+Destroy\+Window or glfw\+Terminate. See \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_window_creation}{Window creation}} for more information.

As the window and context are inseparably linked, the window object also serves as the context handle.

To test the creation of various kinds of contexts and see their properties, run the {\ttfamily glfwinfo} test program.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Vulkan does not have a context and the Vulkan instance is created via the Vulkan API itself. If you will be using Vulkan to render to a window, disable context creation by setting the \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_GLFW_CLIENT_API_hint}{GLFW\+\_\+\+CLIENT\+\_\+\+API}} hint to {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+API}. For more information, see the \mbox{\hyperlink{vulkan_guide}{Vulkan guide}}.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{context_guide_context_hints}{}\doxysubsection{Context creation hints}\label{context_guide_context_hints}
There are a number of hints, specified using glfw\+Window\+Hint, related to what kind of context is created. See \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_window_hints_ctx}{context related hints}} in the window guide.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_sharing}{}\doxysubsection{Context object sharing}\label{context_guide_context_sharing}
When creating a window and its Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES context with glfw\+Create\+Window, you can specify another window whose context the new one should share its objects (textures, vertex and element buffers, etc.) with.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{GLFWwindow* second\_window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Second Window"{}}, NULL, first\_window);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Object sharing is implemented by the operating system and graphics driver. On platforms where it is possible to choose which types of objects are shared, GLFW requests that all types are shared.

See the relevant chapter of the \href{https://www.opengl.org/registry/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL}} or \href{https://www.khronos.org/opengles/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL ES}} reference documents for more information. The name and number of this chapter unfortunately varies between versions and APIs, but has at times been named {\itshape Shared Objects and Multiple Contexts}.

GLFW comes with a bare-\/bones object sharing example program called {\ttfamily sharing}.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_offscreen}{}\doxysubsection{Offscreen contexts}\label{context_guide_context_offscreen}
GLFW doesn\textquotesingle{}t support creating contexts without an associated window. However, contexts with hidden windows can be created with the \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_GLFW_VISIBLE_hint}{GLFW\+\_\+\+VISIBLE}} window hint.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{glfwWindowHint(GLFW\_VISIBLE, GLFW\_FALSE);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{GLFWwindow* offscreen\_context = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}"{}}, NULL, NULL);}

\end{DoxyCode}


The window never needs to be shown and its context can be used as a plain offscreen context. Depending on the window manager, the size of a hidden window\textquotesingle{}s framebuffer may not be usable or modifiable, so framebuffer objects are recommended for rendering with such contexts.

You should still \mbox{\hyperlink{input_guide_events}{process events}} as long as you have at least one window, even if none of them are visible.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_less}{}\doxysubsection{Windows without contexts}\label{context_guide_context_less}
You can disable context creation by setting the \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_GLFW_CLIENT_API_hint}{GLFW\+\_\+\+CLIENT\+\_\+\+API}} hint to {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+API}. Windows without contexts must not be passed to glfw\+Make\+Context\+Current or glfw\+Swap\+Buffers.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_current}{}\doxysection{Current context}\label{context_guide_context_current}
Before you can make Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES calls, you need to have a current context of the correct type. A context can only be current for a single thread at a time, and a thread can only have a single context current at a time.

When moving a context between threads, you must make it non-\/current on the old thread before making it current on the new one.

The context of a window is made current with glfw\+Make\+Context\+Current.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);}

\end{DoxyCode}


The window of the current context is returned by glfw\+Get\+Current\+Context.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{GLFWwindow* window = glfwGetCurrentContext();}

\end{DoxyCode}


The following GLFW functions require a context to be current. Calling any these functions without a current context will generate a GLFW\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+CURRENT\+\_\+\+CONTEXT error.

\item glfw\+Swap\+Interval
\item glfw\+Extension\+Supported
\item glfw\+Get\+Proc\+Address
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{context_guide_context_swap}{}\doxysection{Buffer swapping}\label{context_guide_context_swap}
See \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_buffer_swap}{Buffer swapping}} in the window guide.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext}{}\doxysection{Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES extensions}\label{context_guide_context_glext}
One of the benefits of Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES is their extensibility. Hardware vendors may include extensions in their implementations that extend the API before that functionality is included in a new version of the Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES specification, and some extensions are never included and remain as extensions until they become obsolete.

An extension is defined by\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An extension name (e.\+g. {\ttfamily GL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+gl\+\_\+spirv})
\item New Open\+GL tokens (e.\+g. {\ttfamily GL\+\_\+\+SPIR\+\_\+\+V\+\_\+\+BINARY\+\_\+\+ARB})
\item New Open\+GL functions (e.\+g. {\ttfamily gl\+Specialize\+Shader\+ARB})
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note the {\ttfamily ARB} affix, which stands for Architecture Review Board and is used for official extensions. The extension above was created by the ARB, but there are many different affixes, like {\ttfamily NV} for Nvidia and {\ttfamily AMD} for, well, AMD. Any group may also use the generic {\ttfamily EXT} affix. Lists of extensions, together with their specifications, can be found at the \href{https://www.opengl.org/registry/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL Registry}} and \href{https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL ES Registry}}.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext_auto}{}\doxysubsection{Loading extension with a loader library}\label{context_guide_context_glext_auto}
An extension loader library is the easiest and best way to access both Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES extensions and modern versions of the core Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES APIs. They will take care of all the details of declaring and loading everything you need. One such library is \href{https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad}{\texttt{ glad}} and there are several others.

The following example will use glad but all extension loader libraries work similarly.

First you need to generate the source files using the glad Python script. This example generates a loader for any version of Open\+GL, which is the default for both GLFW and glad, but loaders for Open\+GL ES, as well as loaders for specific API versions and extension sets can be generated. The generated files are written to the {\ttfamily output} directory.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python main.py -\/-\/generator c -\/-\/no-\/loader -\/-\/out-\/path output}

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily -\/-\/no-\/loader} option is added because GLFW already provides a function for loading Open\+GL and Open\+GL ES function pointers, one that automatically uses the selected context creation API, and glad can call this instead of having to implement its own. There are several other command-\/line options as well. See the glad documentation for details.

Add the generated {\ttfamily output/src/glad.\+c}, {\ttfamily output/include/glad/glad.\+h} and {\ttfamily output/include/\+KHR/khrplatform.\+h} files to your build. Then you need to include the glad header file, which will replace the Open\+GL header of your development environment. By including the glad header before the GLFW header, it suppresses the development environment\textquotesingle{}s Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES header.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <glad/glad.h>}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Finally, you need to initialize glad once you have a suitable current context.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}My Window"{}}, NULL, NULL);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (!window)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{gladLoadGLLoader((GLADloadproc) glfwGetProcAddress);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once glad has been loaded, you have access to all Open\+GL core and extension functions supported by both the context you created and the glad loader you generated. After that, you are ready to start rendering.

You can specify a minimum required Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES version with \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_window_hints_ctx}{context hints}}. If your needs are more complex, you can check the actual Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES version with \mbox{\hyperlink{window_guide_window_attribs_ctx}{context attributes}}, or you can check whether a specific version is supported by the current context with the {\ttfamily GLAD\+\_\+\+GL\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+x\+\_\+x} booleans.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (GLAD\_GL\_VERSION\_3\_2)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// Call OpenGL 3.2+ specific code}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


To check whether a specific extension is supported, use the {\ttfamily GLAD\+\_\+\+GL\+\_\+xxx} booleans.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (GLAD\_GL\_ARB\_gl\_spirv)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// Use GL\_ARB\_gl\_spirv}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext_manual}{}\doxysubsection{Loading extensions manually}\label{context_guide_context_glext_manual}
{\bfseries{Do not use this technique}} unless it is absolutely necessary. An \mbox{\hyperlink{context_guide_context_glext_auto}{extension loader library}} will save you a ton of tedious, repetitive, error prone work.

To use a certain extension, you must first check whether the context supports that extension and then, if it introduces new functions, retrieve the pointers to those functions. GLFW provides glfw\+Extension\+Supported and glfw\+Get\+Proc\+Address for manual loading of extensions and new API functions.

This section will demonstrate manual loading of Open\+GL extensions. The loading of Open\+GL ES extensions is identical except for the name of the extension header.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext_header}{}\doxysubsubsection{The glext.\+h header}\label{context_guide_context_glext_header}
The {\ttfamily glext.\+h} extension header is a continually updated file that defines the interfaces for all Open\+GL extensions. The latest version of this can always be found at the \href{https://www.opengl.org/registry/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL Registry}}. There are also extension headers for the various versions of Open\+GL ES at the \href{https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/}{\texttt{ Open\+GL ES Registry}}. It it strongly recommended that you use your own copy of the extension header, as the one included in your development environment may be several years out of date and may not include the extensions you wish to use.

The header defines function pointer types for all functions of all extensions it supports. These have names like {\ttfamily PFNGLSPECIALIZESHADERARBPROC} (for {\ttfamily gl\+Specialize\+Shader\+ARB}), i.\+e. the name is made uppercase and {\ttfamily PFN} (pointer to function) and {\ttfamily PROC} (procedure) are added to the ends.

To include the extension header, define \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLEXT}{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+GLEXT}} before including the GLFW header.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define GLFW\_INCLUDE\_GLEXT}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext_string}{}\doxysubsubsection{Checking for extensions}\label{context_guide_context_glext_string}
A given machine may not actually support the extension (it may have older drivers or a graphics card that lacks the necessary hardware features), so it is necessary to check at run-\/time whether the context supports the extension. This is done with glfw\+Extension\+Supported.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (glfwExtensionSupported(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}GL\_ARB\_gl\_spirv"{}}))}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// The extension is supported by the current context}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The argument is a null terminated ASCII string with the extension name. If the extension is supported, glfw\+Extension\+Supported returns {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+TRUE}, otherwise it returns {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+FALSE}.\hypertarget{context_guide_context_glext_proc}{}\doxysubsubsection{Fetching function pointers}\label{context_guide_context_glext_proc}
Many extensions, though not all, require the use of new Open\+GL functions. These functions often do not have entry points in the client API libraries of your operating system, making it necessary to fetch them at run time. You can retrieve pointers to these functions with glfw\+Get\+Proc\+Address.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{PFNGLSPECIALIZESHADERARBPROC pfnSpecializeShaderARB = glfwGetProcAddress(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}glSpecializeShaderARB"{}});}

\end{DoxyCode}


In general, you should avoid giving the function pointer variables the (exact) same name as the function, as this may confuse your linker. Instead, you can use a different prefix, like above, or some other naming scheme.

Now that all the pieces have been introduced, here is what they might look like when used together.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define GLFW\_INCLUDE\_GLEXT}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}

\DoxyCodeLine{        glSpecializeShaderARB(...);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
